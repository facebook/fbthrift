FBThrift: Facebook's branch of apache thrift [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/fbthrift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/fbthrift)
--------------------------------------------

The main focus of this package is the new C++ server, under thrift/lib/cpp2.  This repo also contains a branch of the rest of apache thrift's repo with any changes Facebook has made, however the build system only supports cpp2.

Apache thrift is at https://thrift.apache.org/

Building
--------

Note that under GCC, you probably need at least 2GB of memory to compile fbthrift.  If you see 'internal compiler error', this is probably because you ran out of memory during compilation.

Dependencies
------------

 - Facebook's folly library: https://github.com/facebook/folly

 - In addition to the packages required for building folly, Ubuntu 13.10 and
   14.04 require the following packages (feel free to cut and paste the apt-get
   command below):

```
  sudo apt-get install \
      flex \
      bison \
      libkrb5-dev \
      libsasl2-dev \
      libnuma-dev \
      pkg-config \
      libssl-dev
```

For your convenience script are provided to install `fbthrift`'s
dependencies on several common platforms:

```sh
cd fbthrift/thrift/
# Or ./build/deps_ubuntu_12.04.sh or ./build/deps_centos.sh
./build/deps_ubuntu_14.04.sh  
autoreconf -if && ./configure && make
```

Each `deps_*.sh` script will install a variety of base system packages, as
well as compile and install into in `/usr/local` some from-source
dependencies (like `folly`).

 - Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit requires the following packages:

    - make
    - autoconf
    - libtool
    - g++
    - libboost-dev-all
    - libevent-dev
    - flex
    - bison
    - libgoogle-glog-dev
    - libdouble-conversion-dev
    - scons
    - libkrb5-dev
    - libsnappy-dev
    - libsasl2-dev
