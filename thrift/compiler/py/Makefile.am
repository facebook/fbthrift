# We don't actually want "make install" to try to install our Python module in
# /usr/local/lib. But we can't use noinst_, as that's special-cased and libtool
# doesn't actually build the shared object (it builds a .a made up of PIC
# object files instead). FUUUUUUUUUUUU.
#
# So we pretend it's a lib library, but *override* the install-exec target
# so it doesn't actually install it. This will be problematic if you add
# other libraries in this directory, so don't.
