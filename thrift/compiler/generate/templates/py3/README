This directory contains the mustache templates used to generate the thrift-py3
implementation. The thrift-py3 implementation wraps the cpp2 generator in
Cython code that links the futures implementation of thrift with the asyncio
library in Python. It requires Python 3.5.2 or higher.

This implementation optimizes for speed by doing as little work inside the GIL
as possible. Objects are stored in memory as C++ objects and are only converted
to Python on demand. All serialization and deserialization happens outside the
GIL. This means it's possible to pass extremely large structures into or out
of the asyncio service without blocking the event loop.

The Python facing side of the implementation uses immutable types to ensure
all thrift types are hashable (and can therefore be used as keys in dictionaries
or returned as exceptions). as a side effect, this also makes the task of
wrapping the structs much simpler. We provide an elegant Pythonic API to
manipulate the immutable types.


HACKING
-------
There are basically four types of files in this directory. See the documentation
at the head of each file for more information. The actual driver that calls
into these mustache files and generates the code lives in
`thrift/compiler/generate/t_mstch_py3_generator.cc`. See
`thrift/doc/mstch.md` for information on how to use the thrift mustache
generators.

Top level files
---------------
These are files that are generated by the mstch_py3 generator and are included
as part of the generated source distribution. They include:

 *  Struct.pxd.mustache
 *  Struct.pyx.mustache
 *  Services.pxd.mustache
 *  ServicesWrapper.cpp.mustache
 *  ServicesWrapper.h.mustache
 *  ServicesWrapper.pxd.mustache
 *  CythonServices.pyx.mustache


Cython Services included files
------------------------------
These files are split out of CythonServices.pyx for maintainability because they
have explicit tasks. They may need to be split out into their own modules later,
especially if the client requires access to the promises.

 *  ServiceCallbacks.mustache
 *  CythonPromises.mustache


Type-specifiers
----------------
The bulk of the partial files are used to implement type-specific behaviors
in different contexts.

 *  ContainerCppFieldType.mustache
 *  ContainerCythonCppToPythonKey.mustache
 *  ContainerCythonCppToPythonItem.mustache
 *  ContainerCythonFieldType.mustache
 *  CppFieldType.mustache
 *  CppPassField.mustache
 *  CythonAssignField.mustache
 *  CythonCppToPython.mustache
 *  CythonFieldType.mustache
 *  CythonPythonToCpp.mustache
 *  CythonReturnValue.mustache
 *  CythonStructGetter.mustache
 *  CythonStructReferenceType.mustache
 *  PythonFieldType.mustache


Utilities
---------
Finally, there are a few files that contain common code that was pulled out
to make the other files more readable. We should probably have more of these

 *  CppMapKeyValue.mustache
 *  CythonMapKeyValue.mustache
 *  ModulePath.mustache
