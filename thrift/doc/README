FBThrift: Facebook's branch of apache thrift
--------------------------------------------

The main focus of this package is the new C++ server, under thrift/lib/cpp2.  This repo also contains a branch of the rest of apache thrift's repo with any changes Facebook has made, however the build system only supports cpp2.

Building
--------

For your convenience, a build script is provided for ubuntu 12.10 64-bit:

cd fbthrift/thrift
./deps.sh

It will automatically pull down folly and build it, and then configure and build thrift.
