description: Go Thrift implementation and usage

# Go

Thrift natively supports Go, with generated types, clients, and server interfaces and a pure-Go RPC runtime. Go clients and servers can communicate with Thrift implementations in other languages.

The [Go runtime](https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/xplat/thrift/lib/go/thrift) is available as the module `github.com/facebook/fbthrift/thrift/lib/go/thrift`. Generate Go code with the compiler's `mstch_go` generator.

## Generated Code

Each Thrift file generates a Go package containing its types, constants, service clients, and server interfaces. Use `namespace go` to specify the import path:

```thrift
namespace go "example.com/project/search"
```

This namespace corresponds to import path `example.com/project/search` and package name `search`. A namespace containing `/` is used as the import path unchanged. Otherwise, every `.` is converted to `/`; for example, `example.search` becomes `example/search`. Use a quoted slash-containing namespace for a domain-qualified import path.

Without an explicit Go namespace, the default is the lowercase Thrift file name without its extension, not a namespace derived from the Thrift `package` declaration.

Use the generated `New<Type>()` constructors to initialize Thrift-defined field defaults. A Go struct literal does not apply those defaults. Thrift exceptions implement Go's `error` interface and are returned as errors from RPC methods.

## Serialization and RPC

The `github.com/facebook/fbthrift/thrift/lib/go/thrift/format` package provides Binary and Compact serialization and deserialization, as well as the deprecated JSON and SimpleJSON formats. Go RPC uses Binary or Compact serialization.

The runtime supports Rocket clients and servers, including Header-to-Rocket upgrades for interoperability with legacy peers. Use Rocket for streaming and interactions.

Go supports both clients and servers for:

- [Server-to-client streaming](https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/xplat/thrift/lib/go/thrift/docs/streaming.md).
- [Client-to-server streaming (sinks)](https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/xplat/thrift/lib/go/thrift/docs/sink.md).
- [Bidirectional streaming](https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/xplat/thrift/lib/go/thrift/docs/bidi.md).
- [Interaction factories](https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/xplat/thrift/lib/go/thrift/docs/interactions.md). Legacy `performs` interaction constructors are not supported.

See the [feature comparison](/features/index.md) for feature-specific support and limitations.
