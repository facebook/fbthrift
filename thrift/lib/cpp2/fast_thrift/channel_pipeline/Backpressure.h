/**
 * WriteReadyHook lets a handler get an onWriteReady() call when the pipeline
 * can take writes again.
 *
 * Embed it as a public member named `writeReadyHook_`. makeHandlerNode finds
 * it at compile time when the handler is added to the pipeline.
 *
 * Result::Backpressure from fireWrite() means the message was accepted, and
 * the transport asks for no more for now. Do not keep that message to resend
 * it. It was moved into fireWrite(), so a resend would pass on an empty box.
 * Queue the messages that come after it instead, and send them from
 * onWriteReady().
 *
 * Call awaitWriteReady() only after a fireWrite() that returned Backpressure.
 * The transport wakes only the handlers it told to stop, so a handler that
 * registers for any other reason never gets onWriteReady().
 *
 * Usage:
 *   class MyHandler {
 *    public:
 *     WriteReadyHook writeReadyHook_;  // Detected by makeHandlerNode
 *     std::deque<TypeErasedBox> pending_;
 *
 *     Result onWrite(ContextImpl& ctx, TypeErasedBox&& msg) noexcept {
 *       if (ctx.isAwaitingWriteReady()) {
 *         pending_.push_back(std::move(msg));
 *         return Result::Backpressure;
 *       }
 *       const Result result = ctx.fireWrite(std::move(msg));
 *       if (result == Result::Backpressure) {
 *         ctx.awaitWriteReady();  // msg was accepted; hold back the next ones
 *       }
 *       return result;
 *     }
 *
 *     void onWriteReady(ContextImpl& ctx) noexcept {
 *       while (!pending_.empty()) {
 *         TypeErasedBox msg = std::move(pending_.front());
 *         pending_.pop_front();
 *         if (ctx.fireWrite(std::move(msg)) == Result::Backpressure) {
 *           return;  // Still registered for the next onWriteReady()
 *         }
 *       }
 *       ctx.cancelAwaitWriteReady();
 *     }
 *   };
