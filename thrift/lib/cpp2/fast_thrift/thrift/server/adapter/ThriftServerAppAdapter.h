/**
 * ThriftServerAppAdapter — base class for generated fast server handlers.
 *
 * The generated <Service>AppAdapter extends this class, inheriting pipeline
 * integration, request dispatch, and the single writeResponse write entry
 * point. Payload construction lives in ResponsePayloads.h — callers build a
 * ThriftServerResponseMessage there, then hand it to writeResponse().
 *
 * Satisfies TailEndpointHandler concept (onRead / onException) and the
 * ThriftAppAdapter concept consumed by ThriftServerCompositeAppAdapter.
 *
 * The adapter holds no terminal-phase state of its own. Close coordination
 * (drain, in-flight reap, deferred closeCallback) is owned by the
 * pipeline-resident ThriftServerConnectionCloseHandler; the adapter just
 * emits the CloseConnection event from close() and fires the user
 * closeCallback in response to the inbound ConnectionClosed event.
 *
 * Lifetime: upper-layer owners must hold the adapter Ptr until
 * closeCallback fires. After that, the adapter may persist independently
 * of the pipeline until in-flight FastHandlerCallbacks drain — each one
 * holds a DestructorGuard on the adapter, so the underlying object stays
 * valid even if the upper-layer Ptr is dropped. Once the pipeline is
 * gone (signaled to the adapter via ConnectionClosed), pipelineActive_
 * is false and straggler writeResponse calls are silently dropped.
 *
 * Threading: when a CPU executor is attached, the generated service path runs
 * off the connection's EventBase. Two refcounts reachable from a request
 * are deliberately non-atomic — this adapter's DelayedDestruction
 * guardCount_, and the ThriftConnContext refcount held via
 * ThriftRequestContext. Both are per-connection, so concurrent requests
 * would contend on them.
 *
 * The invariant that keeps that sound: *both are mutated only on this
 * adapter's EventBase.* Three things uphold it, and all three must survive
 * refactoring together —
 *   1. FastHandlerCallback is constructed on the EventBase, before any
 *      offload, so acquiring the adapter guard happens there.
 *   2. FastHandlerCallback destruction returns to the EventBase, so an
 *      abandoned request destroys its EventBase-local request context there.
 *   3. A completed callback moves the request context into the response
 *      without destroying it. writeResponse moves that response back to the
 *      EventBase before pipeline processing or destruction.
 * Serialized responses return through writeResponse, which performs the hop
 * back to the EventBase.
