/**
 * ThriftServerStreamOpenPayload — the app→mux message that opens a producing
 * stream. It is the "dedicated stream-response variant": distinct from the wire
 * payloads because it additionally carries a [[ProducerPipeline::ConfigFunc]]
 * the stream mux runs to build the stream's producing-end sub-pipeline.
 *
 * The mux consumes it: it constructs a [[ProducerPipeline::Builder]], runs the
 * configFunc to compose the application's producer into it, builds and
 * registers the sub-pipeline (keyed by `initialResponse.streamId`), then
 * forwards `initialResponse` upward as the stream's first chunk. The configFunc
 * never travels past the mux.
 *
 * The configFunc is held behind a `unique_ptr` so this payload stays
 * pointer-sized: it rides `ThriftServerResponseMessage` through
 * `TypeErasedBox`'s inline storage, which a by-value `folly::Function` would
 * overflow.
 *
 * This is the server-stream instance of a producing-open message; the same
 * pattern generalizes side-agnostically once the client-sink / bidi producing
 * paths come online (both also compose a `ProducerPipeline` via a configFunc).
 *
 * It satisfies ThriftPayloadConcept so it can ride the outbound variant, but
 * the mux always consumes it before it can reach the transport, so
 * `toRocketFrame()` is a never-happens guard rather than a real serialization
 * path — see below.
