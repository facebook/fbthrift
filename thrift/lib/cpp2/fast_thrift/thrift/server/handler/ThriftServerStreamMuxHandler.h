/**
 * ThriftServerStreamMuxHandler — a duplex handler in the thrift server pipeline
 * that owns and multiplexes per-stream producing-end sub-pipelines.
 *
 * Placement: just head-ward of the tail app adapter. Outbound stream chunks it
 * injects then traverse every outbound handler (checksum/compression/transport)
 * like a unary response; inbound RequestN reaches it after the upper handlers
 * and is routed here rather than forwarded to the app.
 *
 * Outbound (onWrite): a `ThriftServerStreamOpenPayload` opens a stream — the
 * mux runs its `ProducerPipeline::ConfigFunc` to build and own a sub-pipeline
 * (keyed by streamId), wires the sub-pipeline head's sink back onto this
 * pipeline's write path, and forwards the initial response chunk upward. Every
 * other outbound message passes through.
 *
 * Inbound (onRead): `RequestN` is looked up by streamId and injected into the
 * matching sub-pipeline (not forwarded to the app); an unknown/terminated
 * stream surfaces a protocol error. Unary requests pass through.
 *
 * Cancellation: a wire CANCEL frame is indistinguishable from a unary request
 * cancel (same rocket frame), so the transport adapter decodes it to a
 * broadcast `ThriftServerRequestCancellationEvent`. The mux subscribes and
 * claims the event only when its streamId names a stream it owns — injecting a
 * `stream::Cancel` and tearing the stream down. A streamId it doesn't own is a
 * unary cancel handled by the request-lifecycle handler, so the mux ignores it;
 * the two streamId spaces are disjoint.
 *
 * Teardown: a terminal (`Complete`/`Error` out, or `Cancel` in) surfaces while
 * we are executing inside the sub-pipeline's `fireRead` —
 * `fireRead`/`fireWrite` hold no DestructorGuard, so erasing the entry there
 * would destroy the pipeline mid-call. The terminal only marks the streamId for
 * removal; the mux erases marked entries after the driving `onRead` returns.
 * (Loop-deferred teardown for producers that emit terminals asynchronously —
 * outside an inbound drive — is a follow-up; today's producers emit
 * synchronously under demand.)
