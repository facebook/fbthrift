/**
 * ProducerTailAdapter — the fixed tail endpoint of an established stream's
 * producing-end sub-pipeline, sitting just past the application's producer.
 *
 * Owned by the owning thrift pipeline (which owns the sub-pipeline and the
 * paired head endpoint), it is the inbound demand backstop — not a bridge:
 * unlike the head, no traffic crosses back into the thrift pipeline here.
 *
 * As the tail endpoint it terminates the read (inbound demand) path: the
 * producer is the demand sink, so every `RequestN`/`Cancel` the consumer grants
 * is expected to be consumed by a handler before it reaches the tail. Any frame
 * that exits the pipeline here via `onRead` is unhandled demand — a
 * misconfigured pipeline, e.g. a missing producer — and is a protocol
 * violation: fatal in debug, `Result::Error` in release.
 *
 * The write (outbound) path is not its concern: producer output originates
 * upstream of the tail and flows toward the head, so a tail endpoint has no
 * `onWrite` callback. Exceptions that propagate toward the tail terminate here.
 *
 * Paired with [[ProducerHeadAdapter]], the fixed head endpoint.
