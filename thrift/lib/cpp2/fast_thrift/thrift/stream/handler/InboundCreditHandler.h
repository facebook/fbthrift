/**
 * InboundCreditHandler — enforces the RSocket credit contract on an established
 * stream / sink / bidi exchange. The peer grants credit via REQUEST_N, where
 * one credit authorizes exactly one stream element (a `Payload`). This handler
 * owns the credit budget *privately* (the count never leaves it) and plays two
 * roles:
 *
 *   - Inbound `RequestN` adds to the credit budget and is then **forwarded** on
 *     as demand — the source produces in response to it. The count stays
 *     private; only the demand travels onward. Other inbound frames (e.g.
 *     `Cancel`) pass through untouched.
 *   - Outbound `Payload` spends one credit and is forwarded; the downstream
 *     result (including transport `Backpressure`) propagates unchanged. Writing
 *     a `Payload` while the budget is exhausted overruns the peer's demand — a
 *     credit-contract violation an upstream buffer/producer keeps unreachable
 * by honoring the demand it was granted, so it fatals in debug and is dropped
 *     with `Result::Error` in release. Non-`Payload` outbound frames
 * (`Complete`, `Error`, an outbound `RequestN`) pass through ungated.
 *
 * Side-agnostic: a server stream producer and a client sink producer both spend
 * the credit their peer grants. Scope is credit accounting + contract
 * enforcement only; buffering and demand metering are separate concerns.
