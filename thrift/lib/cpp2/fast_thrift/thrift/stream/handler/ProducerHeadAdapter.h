/**
 * ProducerHeadAdapter — the fixed head endpoint of an established stream's
 * producing-end sub-pipeline (the pipeline an application composes for its
 * stream handler), and the bridge between that sub-pipeline and the owning
 * thrift pipeline.
 *
 * Both directions cross the seam at the head: the owning thrift pipeline
 * injects the consumer's `RequestN`/`Cancel` demand here
 * (`PipelineImpl::fireRead`), and producer output leaves here through the
 * [[StreamSink]] back into that pipeline. The adapter is owned by the owning
 * thrift pipeline, which also owns the sub-pipeline and the paired tail
 * endpoint.
 *
 * As the head endpoint it terminates the write (outbound) path: producer output
 * flows tail->head and exits here via `onWrite`. Rather than forwarding onward
 * (there is nothing past the head), the adapter guards the stream's outbound
 * contract — only `Payload`, `Complete`, and `Error` — and hands the message to
 * the sink, which delivers it to the owning thrift pipeline.
 *
 * The read (inbound) path — the consumer's `RequestN`/`Cancel` demand — is
 * *initiated* at the head by the owning pipeline (`PipelineImpl::fireRead`) and
 * travels head->tail toward the producer; a head endpoint has no `onRead`
 * callback, so the adapter does not see it.
 *
 * Lifecycle: constructed with its output [[StreamSink]] and owned by the owning
 * thrift pipeline. Requiring the sink at construction keeps the head always
 * fully wired: there is no unwired window, so producer output can never reach a
 * head with no sink.
 *
 * Paired with [[ProducerTailAdapter]], the fixed tail endpoint.
