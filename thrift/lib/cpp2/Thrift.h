 * a generic way.
 *
 * For native Cpp2 structs, one could call the corresponding methods
 * directly, but structs generated in compatibility mode (ie. typedef'ed
 * to the Thrift1 version) don't have them; they are defined as free
 * functions named <type>_read, <type>_write, etc, so they can't be accessed
 * generically (because the type name is part of the function name).
 *
 * Cpp2Ops bridges to either struct methods (for native Cpp2 structs)
 * or the corresponding free functions (for structs in compatibility mode).
