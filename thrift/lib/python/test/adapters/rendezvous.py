"""Field adapter that can hold concurrent field reads at a barrier.

While a test sets `RendezvousAdapter.barrier`, every call that converts a field
value waits there. Threads that read the same uncached field all reach the
barrier before any of them stores its value, so a race to fill the struct field
cache happens on every run, with or without the GIL.
